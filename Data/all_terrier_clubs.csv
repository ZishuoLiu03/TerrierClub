alpha Kappa Delta Phi,https://terriercentral.bu.edu/organization/alpha-kappa-delta-phi,boston.akdphi.president@gmail.com,"alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California, Berkeley in the fall of 1989. Four headstrong visionaries: Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, initiated the concept of having an organization that would provide them as well as other young college women the opportunity to experience sisterhood, and to promote what they felt was integral to the development of successful women. After proposing their ideas to women at the Berkeley campus, they along with ten and strong and willful fellow women became the founding sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Together as the charter class, they dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization that would foster not only sisterhood, but scholarship, service, leadership and Asian American awareness as well. The founding sisters: Betty Chu, Karin Co, Susan Kim, Nancy Lee, Sherri Leung, Annie Loo, Belinda Ma, Anita Ng, Serene Ngin, Fannie Pon, Josie Sun, Daisy Wu, Jill Yoshimura and Reina Yuan, came together to share one another's goals for a promising union. These ideals were to later set the foundation and purpose for alpha Kappa Delta Phi. The love and generosity that each member had for the organization was instrumental to the growth of alpha Kappa Delta Phi's reputation as a sorority, as well as to the forging of unbreakable friendships. In its first step towards achieving widespread acknowledgement, alpha Kappa Delta Phi was recognized by the College Panhellenic Association of Berkeley, California on February 7, 1990, which date is celebrated annually as National Founders' Day. The sisterhood has since then spread to prominent university campuses around the nation. To meet the needs of the growing sisterhood, the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established in May of 1993 at the National Convention in Santa Barbara, California. It is the sincere wish of the founding sisters that alpha Kappa Delta Phi continue to promote the ideals on which the organization was founded and to provide each woman with the resources, unique sisterly support and understanding to achieve her goals in life. Our mission is to provide sisterhood among women, scholarship, leadership and Asian-awareness in the University and community. Further, also to provide a support group for those in their times of need and to encourage the making of successful women. To accomplish our mission, we will: Create a climate that encourages teamwork, creativity and innovation, and above all, Give our unmoving and absolute support and encouragement to those we hold dear to our hearts.",https://bostonakdphi.wixsite.com/buakdphi,https://www.instagram.com/bostonakdphi/,https://www.facebook.com/bostonakdphi,,,success,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This platform will serve as a live map of BU?? engineering ecosystem, making it simpler than ever for students to find organizations aligned with their passions, whether they??e looking to join competitive teams, advocacy groups, or professional societies. As the app grows, we hope to incorporate features like club event calendars, notifications, and student-submitted feedback to continually improve usability and engagement. Additionally, we will be talking to professors to have a list of much of the research going on at BU and how students can contact those professors. This resource will help demystify the research process, especially for younger students, by offering transparency and clarity into lab goals, required skills, and open positions. By highlighting current projects and making mentorship more approachable, we aim to lower the barriers to entering academic research and help students build long-term relationships with faculty. Aside from the mobile application, we will coordinate with other more specific academic engineering societies (like IEEE, MechE, Biomed Society, etc...) to hold combined social events where we can provide undergraduate engineering students with food, games, and the opportunity to meet students of similar or different backgrounds and interests, creating a more diverse and wider net for BUs blossoming engineers.

Let's Talk About It,https://terriercentral.bu.edu/organization/letstalkaboutit,letstalk@bu.edu,"Let's Talk About It aims to promote self-care and mindfulness by creating a safe space for both formal and informal conversations about mental health. Members will check in on each others' daily lives and promote everyday acts of kindness for ourselves and others. We will provide healthy coping strategies for those struggling with stress, anxiety, and other difficulties. We plan to host workshops and discussions centered around wellness, while also being a social club where students can come to chat and relax. Our target audience is any BU student seeking to work on their mental health and self-growth in a non-judgemental space with other like-minded people. We are committed to providing a diverse, inclusive environment with students from all different backgrounds who can all offer their unique perspectives towards mental health. We hope to provide students with a foundation in mindfulness that they will be able to build upon throughout their life while also allowing for opportunities to lower and handle the current stresses that come with being in college. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the mental health struggles our generation faces, which inspired us to create a club that prepares people to cope with stress during the pandemic but also in the long term. Many don't realize the impact of mindfulness until they are faced with mental health crises. One of our goals is to stop the problem before it begins. By encouraging students to practice self-care regularly, we hope that it will keep them in a healthy mindset and provide them with strategies for when problems arise. Self-care is often overlooked as many students prioritize their studies or social lives over their wellbeing. Recently, there have been attempts to improve students' mental health through occasional wellness events and discussions hosted by the BU administration or clubs that are related to the topic of wellness. However, Let's Talk About It will provide an ongoing space for students to have a stigma-free community to learn mindfulness techniques and coping skills by promoting the importance of self-care at Boston University. We will also encourage and host challenges promoting everyday acts of kindness in the BU Community. Everyone in the club will have a say on what kind of workshops we hold or discussions we host. Members will have access to an anonymous form where they may express what they are presently struggling with and submit their suggestions to the E-Board. Our platform will be easily accessible and provide a broad range of topics based on the members' most relevant wants and needs. Meetings will occur every other week on a set day and time and workshops will be held on the &ldquo;off weeks&rdquo; without a set day or time. We will focus on specific mental health topics during meetings that give members direct mechanisms to handle their stress. These discussions will be hosted by guest speakers who will lead the members through an open discussion about the topic of interest. Each meeting will start with breathing exercises so we can all enter a more relaxed state of mind. We will then progress into a presentation that starts the conversation and explains the topic of interest for the evening. We will break off into small groups to check in with each other and then express our ideas about the topic. After the conversation, there will be a small meditation to re-center everyone, as many of these discussions can be difficult to have. During workshops, we plan on teaching members how to knit, about the use of crystals, the benefits of meditation/yoga, and other self-care and wellness-related activities. In these workshops, there will be a designated leader that will guide the members through the planned activity (sometimes there will be a few leaders, e.g. learning crocheting requires hands-on help and therefore more helpers). At the end of the workshop, we will have an open discussion about the activity and how it helps to cope with stress. We also plan to raise money through fundraisers (such as selling merchandise, bake sales, social media challenges, etc.) to donate to different mental health organizations. Members will vote to decide where the donation will be going. These fundraisers will occasionally be in collaboration with other clubs and organizations at BU. At the beginning of the fall semester, we will start with more laid-back conversations about mental health when the club is just getting started so the members can get to know each other a little better first before diving into difficult conversations. It's possible that members may feel uncomfortable at first so we'll ease this tension by facilitating bonding exercises and mental health check-ins while asking for suggestions about what members would like to discuss later in the semester. We will then take these suggestions into account and start our schedule of discussions once every other week with wellness events and workshops on the &ldquo;off weeks.&rdquo; A general schedule of wellness events will be determined before the start of each semester so that the appropriate funding may be allocated. We believe these are realistic goals because we already have connections within the BU community and beyond. We already have guest speakers lined up for the fall semester who have agreed to lead discussions on LGBTQIA+ mental health, eating disorders, body image, sexual health, and other related topics. These include other clubs at BU such as Active Minds BU, professors at BU such as Sarah Gilbert, or doctors such as Dr. Sara Haverty. There are 40 members on our mailing list and over 110 followers on our Instagram page. Furthermore, we have already hosted a general interest meeting, where students expressed their need for a club like ours on campus. During the summer, we plan to continue to grow our social media following and reach out to more potential guest speakers and clubs to collaborate with while preparing presentations and tentative schedules for the fall semester. Though current clubs have wellness activities planned, there is no student group focused specifically on self-care and practicing mindfulness within a close-knit community. Our club will be an accessible and highly useful resource for students struggling with their mental health.",,,,,,success,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While holding true to the values of the national organization, the Zeta Pi chapter works to define what it means to be a fraternity man. While these experiences alone help develop leadership skills, our true goal is to promote ethical leadership in both our chapter and our community. In the brotherhood, our resident council is comprised of men from many different nationalities, backgrounds, and experiences. Phi Tau's style of government ensures the opinions, ideas, and views of all our brothers are thoughtfully and meaningfully considered. The democratic nature of our leadership structure lends fluidly to the inclusion of many sentiments and perspectives. Outside of the chapter, ethical leadership means taking on relevant and impactful problems. Since our founding, our brothers have worked diligently against sexual assault in our community. Rather than taking a passive stance, our brothers have addressed the issue head-on by leading sexual assault awareness and education groups such as BU's 16K Strong. This involvement keeps our members and other BU students informed, aware, and empowered to make change. In addition to this involvement, the Zeta Pi chapter also weaves ethical leadership into community service by confronting another large issue: climate change. Our numerous events, which have included cleaning up the Charles River and services for Boston's National Audubon Society, share an emphasis on ecological conservation. Our brotherhood has embraced the opportunity to model the way to a cleaner and more environmentally responsible future. Each semester, our chapter donates over $2500 to SeriousFun, a non-profit that offers camps to children with terminal or debilitating illnesses.

Survivor: Boston University,https://terriercentral.bu.edu/organization/survivorbu,survivorbostonuni@gmail.com,"The Game: Survivor as a show has a simple format. Every week there is a &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; (see challenges section for further details), where the winner(s) of the challenge are immune and safe from being &ldquo;voted out&rdquo; of the game. Throughout the week, players can talk and strategize to vote off one of the players that is not immune from being voted out, culminating in the votes being read. The game can be full of twists and turns and surprise &ldquo;double vote offs&rdquo;, all until a winner is crowned at the end of the semester, dubbed &ldquo;sole survivor&rdquo;. The Challenges: Each challenge in Survivor BU typically follows one of 3 categories: mental, physical, or social. Mental challenges tend to be memory games like brain-teasers or puzzles, like a jigsaw or slide puzzle. Physical challenges tend to involve running and endurance tests. For example, we have had players run to grab puzzle pieces, toss bean bags and run to pick them up, or on the endurance side, hold up one arm for as long as possible or stand on one foot for as long as possible. Social challenges include games that test a players ability to make connections and draw conclusions about said connections. The main social challenge we have done every semester is called &ldquo;Touchy Subjects&rdquo; where players are asked questions about each other in the large group, for example, everyone is asked &ldquo;Who is most likely to sleep through their 9AM class?&rdquo; and everyone will answer a fellow player, and the people who answer the player who has the most votes will get a point. Therefore, challenges are fun, quick, and a large part of what makes the game like the CBS show, though at a much less extreme level. Our Production Team: Survivor: BU's production team is an ever growing team of students who are interested in Survivor, reality TV, and film and TV production as a whole. Our group of students range from those who have played our club's game, to those who want to help out without the pressure of signing up to be a contestant. More significantly, contestants who are voted out before the jury section of the game, (around halfway through the semester), are encouraged to join production in order to join our greater community outside of the competitive game and help our production team run smoothly. Production members of Survivor: BU gain knowledge of still/moving camerawork through smartphones and standing cameras, general footage sharing and dynamic editing, and collaborative set design and management when an episode is recorded. Many production members know that the amount that you put in for the show is how much entertainment value you will get out. This means our production members can individually choose how much to put in, but because of that choice, there's a general consensus that production has to be a strong backbone to ensure contestants have an enjoyable and fair game. Our Community &amp; Events: Survivor: BU has many outside activities beyond the show production happening during the semester. For one, every Wednesday we meet to play board games and watch episodes of the show Survivor, so we build a community around our status as fans of the show and play board games together to bond. Additionally, many players who are voted out of the game stick around afterwards! For example, every single player from our last season either joined our production crew, attended future production shoots or attended the season finale party, so everyone is encouraged to return to club events regardless of status in the game. We also host minigames of Survivor and other similar game shows during the semester, so even when the game is not being played there are other social strategy games offered to club members. Overall, we encourage everyone to stick around during the season and actively host events like Survivor watch parties, plan board game nights and host other strategy shows for club members to participate in! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hj_Fwv5ejk",,,,,,success,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Beacon team has big dreams for the fall 2024 semester. We are re-envisioning the Beacon as more than just a magazine, hoping to bring writers across campus together for a series of exciting social events. Our vision for the semester includes hosting: Open Mic Nights Writer's Workshops (Speed dating with our Editors!) Guest Speaker Lectures/Masterclasses Slam Poetry Competitions 2025 Issue Release Party And more! In addition to holding events, we are working towards a physical magazine publication. Our magazine will be of professional caliber, curated to the highest standard, and feature a collaboration with the BU's graphic design students.
